Haptic interactions inherently need to consider the material that comes into contact with the user. These may be stiff materials such as plastics or metals, but it may also include deformable, soft materials like textiles. The emergence of electronic textiles (e-textiles) allows for sensing and actuating to be embedded into textile forms that can be integrated in clothing or act as a ‘skin’ for robots. Textiles however are not a homogeneous category of materials. Variations in construction and material composition can result in drastically different properties. 

This workshop will be a hands-on tutorial session covering the basics of textile design and e-textile sensor construction. Different kinds of conductive threads and fabrics will be presented and participants will get to make a series of e-textile sensors to take with them.
